# What is Tau?

Tau introduces a next-gen decentralized exchange providing liquidity, an auto-farming stablecoin, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on the Filecoin Hyperspace network. 
Tau allows users on the [Hyperspace Network](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) to trade directly from their wallets rather than through a 3rd-party -- your tokens never leave your custody, and are 100% owned by you. Further, low trading fees and high liquidity makes Tau an attractive platform to trade with, and also helps provide a broad range of support to various facets of the Filecoin community -- to continuously adapt to the changing markets by continuing to provide value to both token holders and the community.
