# What is Tau?

Tau introduces a next-gen decentralized exchange providing liquidity, an auto-farming stablecoin, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on the Filecoin Hyperspace network. 
Tau allows users on the [Hyperspace Network](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) to trade directly from their wallets rather than through a 3rd-party -- your tokens never leave your custody, and are 100% owned by you. Further, low trading fees and high liquidity makes Tau an attractive platform to trade with, and also helps provide a broad range of support to various facets of the Filecoin community -- to continuously adapt to the changing markets by continuing to provide value to both token holders and the community. Tau provides the following features:

1. High-efficiency swapping (fork of Uniswap; made more gas-efficient)
2. Yield Farming
3. Capital-efficient Lending & Borrowing Protocol
4. Auto-farming Stablecoin (`taUSD`)
5. Secure Cross-chain Bridge


# 1. Swapping Crypto

Quickly swap crypto tokens on Filecoin. Tau's implementation is a more gas-optimized version of [Uniswap v2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2). You can also add liquidity to the various pools supported to further strengthen the protocol.

# 2. Yield Farming

With the liquidity pool tokens you receive when you supply liquidity, you can choose to farm these tokens in our high-yield farm vaults. In return, you receive an amount (scaled by demand) of `TAU` tokens, which are governance tokens on Tau. The longer you stake your liquidity pool tokens, the more amount of `TAU` you will receive.

# 3. Lending & Borrowing

Tau introduces an institution-grade DeFi borrowing and lending protocol featuring ***permissionless*** liquidity pools, allowing anyone to lend and borrow assets at high APYs. The source code for Tau's Lending & Borrowing protocol is [*massive* and *rigorously-tested*.
